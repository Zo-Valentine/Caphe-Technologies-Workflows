## 🎯 Next Steps

### Immediate Actions:

1. ✅ **Create Metadata for Remaining Workflows**
   - 9 workflows need metadata.json files
   - Use the template and email-triage example as reference

2. ✅ **Write README Documentation**
   - Detailed setup instructions
   - Use cases and examples
   - Troubleshooting guides

3. ✅ **Test Workflows**
   - Verify each workflow imports correctly
   - Document any missing credentials
   - Update instructions as needed

### Future Enhancements:

4. **Add More Workflows**
   - Find or create workflows for empty categories
   - Aim for 3-5 workflows per subcategory
   - Balance difficulty levels (beginner/intermediate/advanced)

5. **Create Workflow Index**
   - Searchable database/JSON of all workflows
   - Filterable by category, difficulty, integration
   - For front-end consumption

6. **Build Front-End**
   - Workflow browser interface
   - Search and filter functionality
   - Workflow detail pages

## 💡 Recommendations

### Priority 1: Documentation
Complete metadata and README files for the 9 undocumented workflows using the email-triage-agent example as a template.

### Priority 2: Diversification
Add workflows for underrepresented categories:
- Marketing automation (email campaigns, social media)
- E-commerce (order processing, inventory)
- Finance (invoicing, expense tracking)

### Priority 3: Testing
Test each workflow to ensure:
- Imports successfully
- Credentials can be configured
- Instructions are accurate

### Priority 4: Front-End
Once we have 30-50 workflows documented, start building the browsable front-end interface.
